# pewlett-hackard-analysis
Module 7 of UCB Data Science Bootcamp

### Analysis Overview
The purpose for this analysis to determine the set of employees who will likely be retiring from Pewlett-Hackard within a period of five years and to determine the eligible employees for a mentorship program for their eventual replacement.

### Results
The potential set of retiring employees was determined by filtering Pewlett-Hackard employees who were born between January 1st, 1952 and December 31st, 1955.

The following tables were created and exported as .csv datasets:

    - retirement_titles.csv, which includes the set of all retiring employees and all of the titles they held at Pewlett-Hackard.
    - unique_titles.csv, which only includes the latest title held by Pewlett-Hackard retiring employees
    - retiring_titles.csv which displays the breakdown of retiring employees by their respective titles and corresponding counts

72,458 employees are projected to retire within the next five years. The breakdown by title is as follows:

    - 25,916 Senior Engineers
    - 24,926 Senior Staff
    - 9,285 Engineers
    - 7,636 Staff
    - 3,603 Technique Leaders
    - 1,090 Assistant Engineers
    - 2 Managers

1,549 employees were identified as potential candidates for a mentorship program. The breakdown by title is as follows:

     - 569 Senior Staff
     - 529 Senior Engineers
     - 190 Engineers
     - 155 Staff
     - 77 Technique Leaders
     - 29 Assistant Engineers

### Summary
Up to 72,458 positions may need to be filled according to the projections we calculated for the "silver tsunami". A total of 1,549 current employees were identified as potential mentors for the future generation of employees. This number may increase in future projections, but it does not appear to be enough to fill the projected future demand for mentoring the number of positions that will need to be filled.
